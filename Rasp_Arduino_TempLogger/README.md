# Temperature plotterThis  project uses a raspberry pi and one or manu arduinos.Each arduino card is connected to a NRF24L01+ RF module that is used for bluetooth low energy communication tool.It also has a humidity-temperature sensor DHT11The raspberry logs the received data and shows it as a graph.For future releases, the raspberry logs are going to be stored in a MySQL database thet can be accessed through A Web app.## Arduino appThe arduino application dépends on the following libraries :DHT Library for communicating with the DHT11 sensorBTLE Library for using NRF24L01+ as A Bluetooth Low Energy advertiserRF24 Library needed for BTLE Library
